ChUI Perfumes with Angularjs
============================

##Example of ChocolateChip-UI using Angularjs for Data Binding

This is a simple example to show how to use Angularjs with ChocolateChip-UI. For better functionality you would need to write Angular directives to replace standard ChocolateChip-UI widgets. If you're familiar with Angular, this should not be difficult. Look at the source code for the widgets you need and use that as the starting point for writing your directives.

This example is running on top of Node/Express, so before you can run it you need to install the dependencies by runing `npm install` in this directory. To launch the app use: `node app.js`. This will load the app at: localhost:8080
